Them eight-legged sea devils known as octopuses be lurkin' in every briny deep across the seven seas!\n\nYe can find these crafty creatures in coastal waters around the world - from the shallows to the deep blue, from tropical waters to the cold depths. They be particularly fond of coral reefs, rocky bottoms, and seagrass beds where they can squeeze their boneless bodies into wee crevices and caves.\n\nThe clever beasts be found in every ocean, from the warm Caribbean to the icy waters off Antarctica! Some of the wily creatures even make their homes in tide pools, where they wait for high tide to return, just like a pirate waitin' for the fog to roll in before attackin'!\n\nShiver me timbers, they be remarkable creatures of the deep!
